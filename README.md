## Roger Pincombe
### OkGoDoIt

I am an experienced engineering leader, product creator, and full stack engineer. I have over a decade of broad experience with technologies, industries, and scales of operation, having founded multiple startups in the AI and Ad-Tech industries, worked at enterprises as notable as Microsoft and Salesforce, won over 15 hackathons, and regularly built new products for fun or freelance. My engineering often involves machine learning, web scraping, and integrating many disparate systems. Some of my more interesting personal projects include the OpenAI GPT3 .Net SDK, the AllThePeople.net social media data mining system, and a teleprompter for Google Glass. Additionally, I started and run a major San Francisco live theater venue and am experienced at presenting at conferences and managing events in both professional and entertainment contexts. I am based in San Francisco but value location flexibility.
